Hey husklyfren! I've put together a complete implementation of the OmniDork project, merging your quantum resonant search engine with the OSINT automation framework and proxy scanner.
The project now has these key components:

**Main Application (`main.rs`)** - The unified command center that integrates all functionality with a menu-driven interface for different modes of operation.
**DorkEngine Module (`dork_engine.rs`)** - Handles all Google dorking capabilities, with specialized dorks for subdomain discovery, sensitive content exposure, vulnerabilities, and API endpoints.
**ProxyScanner Module (`proxy_scanner.rs`)** - Implements comprehensive proxy discovery and validation, including anonymity checking and speed testing.
**VulnerabilityMatcher Module (`vulnerability_matcher.rs`)** - Analyzes findings from various sources to detect security issues with configurable patterns.
**BugBounty Module (`bug_bounty.rs`)** - Matches discoveries to bug bounty programs and estimates potential rewards.
**Quantum Search Engine Module (`engine.rs`)** - Contains the core quantum-inspired search logic.

These all build upon your existing quantum resonant search engine modules (tokenizer, prime_hilbert, entropy, quantum_types, etc.) and incorporate elements from the open redirect logic provided previously.
How It All Works Together
When you run the application, you can choose between five operating modes:

**OSINT and Vulnerability Scanning** - Focused on finding security issues using `dork_engine.rs` and `vulnerability_matcher.rs`.
**Quantum Resonant Search** - Your original search engine with enhancements, utilizing `engine.rs` and related modules.
**Proxy Scanning** - Finds and validates anonymous proxies using `proxy_scanner.rs`.
**Open Redirect Vulnerability Scan** - Specialized vulnerability testing, integrated within `main.rs`.
**Full Integrated Scan** - Combines all capabilities for comprehensive analysis, orchestrated by `main.rs`.

The integrated scan is particularly powerful as it:

First runs OSINT to discover the attack surface using `dork_engine.rs`.
Then applies quantum resonant crawling to index the discovered content using `crawler.rs` and `engine.rs`.
Finds proxies that can be used for anonymous scanning using `proxy_scanner.rs`.
Analyzes everything together using `vulnerability_matcher.rs` and generates integrated reports via `main.rs`.
Matches findings to bug bounty programs for potential rewards using `bug_bounty.rs`.

Key Improvements

Database Schema Integration - Uses your PostgreSQL schema for structured storage (conceptually, as implemented in the `lib.rs` structs).
Concurrency Optimization - With proper `async`/`await` patterns and Tokio runtime.
Memory Management - Compression for large documents in `engine.rs`.
Visualization Generation - For network graphs and timelines of findings, handled in `main.rs`.
Checkpoint System - Save and resume capabilities in `engine.rs`.

Is there a specific part of the implementation you'd like me to explain in more detail, woflfren?
