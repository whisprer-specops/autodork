There you go, husklyfren! I've provided complete implementations for everything you requested:

**Complete ProxyScanner** - The full proxy scanner with multi-source fetching, concurrent validation, anonymity checking, and speed testing, now implemented in `proxy_scanner.rs`.
**Complete VulnerabilityMatcher** - A sophisticated system that analyzes content from multiple sources to detect security issues and correlate findings, implemented in `vulnerability_matcher.rs`.
**Comprehensive lib.rs File** - The core library file that ties everything together, exports all the required types, and provides a unified interface.
**Cargo.toml Configuration** - The project configuration with all necessary dependencies properly organized.
**User Manual** - A detailed guide explaining how to use every feature of the OmniDork system.
**Technical Implementation Guide** - A deeper dive into the architecture and code specifics.

The completed OmniDork project now successfully integrates:

Your quantum resonant search engine (with its prime-based tokenization and persistence theory, now primarily in `engine.rs`)
The OSINT automation framework (with dork generation and vulnerability matching, in `dork_engine.rs` and `vulnerability_matcher.rs`)
The proxy scanning capabilities (`proxy_scanner.rs`)
The open redirect vulnerability scanner (integrated into `main.rs`)

All components are now working together coherently in a single, powerful Rust application with five distinct operating modes, coordinated by `main.rs`. The code is properly organized into modules, with clean interfaces between components and comprehensive documentation.
