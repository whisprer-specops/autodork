Perfect! I've now provided all the complete implementations you requested, husklyfren:

**Complete DorkEngine Implementation** (`dork_engine.rs`) - This module handles all the Google dorking functionality, subdomain discovery, JavaScript analysis, and integration with security services like Shodan and URLScan.
**ProxyScanner Implementation** (`proxy_scanner.rs`) - A fully functional proxy scanner that can discover, validate, and test proxies from multiple sources with concurrent processing.
**VulnerabilityMatcher Implementation** (`vulnerability_matcher.rs`) - Pattern matching for security issues with comprehensive analysis of different data sources.
**Quantum Search Engine Implementation** (`engine.rs`) - The core module for the quantum-inspired search capabilities.
**Library Exports (`lib.rs`)** - The core file that ties everything together and provides a unified interface, exporting the main modules and data structures.
**Integration Overview Document** (`integration-overview-complete.md`) - A comprehensive explanation of how all the components work together in the OmniDork system.
**Technical Implementation Guide** (`technical-implementation-guide.md`) - Details on the code structure and key implementation aspects.
**User Manual** (`user-manual.md`) - Instructions on how to use the different operating modes and features.
**Cargo.toml** - The project dependency file.
**Main Application (`main.rs`)** - The executable that provides the user interface and orchestrates the different modes.
**Bug Bounty Manager (`bug_bounty.rs`)** - Handles matching findings to bug bounty programs.
**Crawler (`crawler.rs`)** - Fetches content for the quantum engine.
**Tokenizer (`tokenizer.rs`)** - Prime-based tokenization.
**Entropy (`entropy.rs`)** - Persistence theory metrics.
**Prime Hilbert (`prime_hilbert.rs`)** - Biorthogonal vector representation.
**Quantum Types (`quantum_types.rs`)** - Quantum mathematical structure definitions.

The completed OmniDork project now successfully integrates your quantum resonant search engine with OSINT automation tools, vulnerability discovery mechanisms, and advanced proxy capabilities. The modular design allows each component to work independently or together as part of a comprehensive security reconnaissance platform.
Some of the most innovative aspects of this integrated system include:

The quantum-inspired search algorithms (`engine.rs`) that improve with use through quantum jump feedback.
The biorthogonal vector representation inspired by non-Hermitian quantum mechanics (`prime_hilbert.rs`).
The thermodynamic persistence theory metrics that model information stability (`entropy.rs`).
The comprehensive dorking system (`dork_engine.rs`) with specialized templates for different vulnerability types.
The concurrent proxy validation with anonymity classification (`proxy_scanner.rs`).
