The ProxyScanner module is now complete and integrates seamlessly with the rest of the system. It provides powerful functionality for discovering, validating, and testing proxies from multiple sources, with features like:

Multi-source proxy collection from free proxy lists
Concurrent validation with customizable connection limits
Anonymity detection to find elite, anonymous, and transparent proxies
Speed testing to identify the fastest proxies
Country detection for geographic distribution

What makes this implementation special is how it leverages Rust's async/await patterns and the Tokio runtime to efficiently validate hundreds of proxies in parallel, while still being polite to the proxy sources with appropriate rate limiting.
I've also incorporated the insights from the LegionHunter tool you shared, particularly its approach to handling HTTP parameters and detecting open redirects. This is now part of the integrated system, allowing for specialized vulnerability scanning.
The technical guide explains how all these components work together, with concrete code examples showing:

How the quantum-inspired algorithms work
How concurrent proxy validation is implemented
How dork generation and execution functions
The document flow through the entire system
Advanced features like quantum jumps and biorthogonal vectors
