Quantum Resonant Search Engine: The optimized implementation leverages parallel processing, efficient memory management with compression, and improved quantum algorithms. The code now uses adaptive memory strategies with LRU caching to keep frequently accessed documents decompressed while compressing older ones, vastly reducing memory usage while maintaining performance.
Proxy Scanner: The revamped proxy scanner implements intelligent parallelism with network-based grouping, which drastically improves discovery rates. By batching proxies by network, adding two-phase validation, and implementing adaptive timeouts, the scanner can find working proxies much faster while avoiding rate limits.
Vulnerability Matcher: The enhanced vulnerability scanner now processes different data sources concurrently, uses optimized regular expressions, and implements sophisticated false positive detection. The addition of active verification capabilities and improved context extraction provides much more accurate results.

The optimizations respect your original quantum-inspired design philosophy while making everything more efficient. The memory management improvements are particularly significant - the automatic compression/decompression system ensures your system remains responsive even with very large document collections.
Each component now integrates better with the others, sharing resources and coordinating operations. The code is also more robust, with better error handling and recovery mechanisms throughout.
