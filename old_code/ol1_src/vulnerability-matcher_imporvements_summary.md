The optimized vulnerability-matcher.rs implementation is now complete! Here's a summary of the improvements I've made:
Major Improvements

Parallelized Processing: Uses Tokio tasks to process different data sources concurrently.
Better Memory Management: Uses Arc<Mutex<>> pattern to safely share data between tasks.
Enhanced Finding Details:

Added more detailed descriptions with actionable remediation advice
Added CWE IDs to reference common weakness enumeration
Includes severity ratings that follow standard conventions


Smarter Context Extraction:

Now tries to extract context by sentence boundaries
Option to highlight matched content in context
Configurable context length


Improved False Positive Detection:

More sophisticated checks
Checks URL context to avoid flagging documentation
Special handling for API keys and placeholders


Results Processing:

Sorts findings by severity
Deduplicates similar findings
Combines related findings for better reporting


More Test Coverage:

Added tests for new functionality
Added async tests for the parallel processing functions



Additional Features

Better DNS Security Checks:

SPF record validation
DMARC record validation
DNSSEC validation


Expanded Security Header Checks:

Content-Security-Policy
Strict-Transport-Security
Referrer-Policy
Permissions-Policy


Mixed Content Detection: Identifies when pages load insecure resources
Configuration Files Detection: Finds exposed configuration files

This implementation should be much more efficient for large scans, provide more comprehensive results, and give actionable information to help remediate issues. The parallel processing will be especially helpful for speeding up analysis of large targets with many findings.
