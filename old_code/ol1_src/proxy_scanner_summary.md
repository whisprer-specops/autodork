Network-based Grouping: Proxies are now grouped by network/region, which allows for smarter batch processing and significantly reduces the chance of getting rate-limited or blocked.
Adaptive Concurrency: The scanner automatically adjusts the number of concurrent connections based on network characteristics and group size, maximizing efficiency without overwhelming proxy sources.
Two-Phase Validation: The system first performs a fast initial check on proxies before committing resources to full validation, dramatically speeding up the overall process.
Smart Rate Limiting: Domain-specific rate limiting prevents triggering blocks while maintaining maximum throughput.
Enhanced Metadata: The proxy structure now contains additional fields like success rate, stability score, region, and ASN information, enabling much smarter decision-making.

In your original proxy scanner, all proxies were validated with the same strategy, regardless of their source reliability or network characteristics. The optimized version is much more sophisticated, with special handling for different types of proxy sources and intelligent parallel processing.
