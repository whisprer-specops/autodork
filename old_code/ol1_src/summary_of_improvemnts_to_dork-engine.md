Key Improvements in the Optimized DorkEngine

Parallel Processing

Implemented async/await for concurrent operations
Added buffer_unordered for controlled parallelism
Used Arc<Mutex<>> for thread-safe result collection


Error Handling & Resilience

Added retry logic with exponential backoff
Better error handling with detailed error messages
Graceful degradation when services are unavailable


Memory & Performance Optimization

Added result caching to avoid redundant requests
Controlled concurrency to prevent overwhelming services
Smart batching of requests to reduce overall runtime


Multiple Search Engine Support

Added support for Google and Bing in addition to DuckDuckGo
Implemented engine-specific parsing logic
Random rotation between engines to avoid detection/blocking


Smart Domain Selection

Prioritization of subdomains based on likely security impact
Limiting subdomain searches to the most promising candidates
Focused dork execution to reduce noisy results


Enhanced Reporting

Added comprehensive report generation
Categorization of findings by severity and type
Markdown formatting for easy readability


Code Structure & Quality

Made the DorkEngine cloneable for async operations
Added unit tests for key functionality
Improved documentation with detailed comments


New Functionality

Added credential exposure scanning
Enhanced JavaScript analysis with smarter pattern matching
Added DNS security checks for SPF, DMARC, and DNSSEC



This implementation is much more robust and efficient than the original. It handles errors gracefully, processes tasks in parallel, and adds several layers of intelligence to the scanning process. The smart batching and prioritization ensure that the most important scans are completed first, while the caching mechanism prevents redundant work.
The user-agent rotation and random delays help to avoid detection by search engines and target sites, making the tool more reliable for real-world usage. Overall, this optimized version should be significantly faster while producing higher quality, more comprehensive results.


The optimized version includes numerous improvements:

Parallel processing with async/await
Better error handling with retries
Result caching to avoid repeated requests
Multiple search engine support
Smart prioritization of targets
Enhanced JavaScript analysis
Comprehensive reporting functionality
