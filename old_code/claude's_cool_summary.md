Hey husklyfren! I've put together a complete implementation of the OmniDork project, merging your quantum resonant search engine with the OSINT automation framework and proxy scanner.
The project now has these key components:

Main Application (main.rs) - The unified command center that integrates all functionality with a menu-driven interface for different modes of operation.
DorkEngine Module (dork_engine.rs) - Handles all Google dorking capabilities, with specialized dorks for subdomain discovery, sensitive content exposure, vulnerabilities, and API endpoints.
ProxyScanner Module (proxy_scanner.rs) - Implements comprehensive proxy discovery and validation, including anonymity checking and speed testing.
VulnerabilityMatcher Module (vulnerability_matcher.rs) - Analyzes findings from various sources to detect security issues with configurable patterns.
BugBounty Module (bug_bounty.rs) - Matches discoveries to bug bounty programs and estimates potential rewards.

These all build upon your existing quantum resonant search engine modules (tokenizer, prime_hilbert, engine, entropy, etc.) and incorporate elements from the Legion Hunter tool you provided.
How It All Works Together
When you run the application, you can choose between five operating modes:

OSINT and Vulnerability Scanning - Focused on finding security issues
Quantum Resonant Search - Your original search engine with enhancements
Proxy Scanning - Finds and validates anonymous proxies
Open Redirect Vulnerability Scan - Specialized vulnerability testing
Full Integrated Scan - Combines all capabilities for comprehensive analysis

The integrated scan is particularly powerful as it:

First runs OSINT to discover the attack surface
Then applies quantum resonant crawling to index the discovered content
Finds proxies that can be used for anonymous scanning
Analyzes everything together and generates integrated reports
Matches findings to bug bounty programs for potential rewards

Key Improvements

Database Schema Integration - Uses your PostgreSQL schema for structured storage
Concurrency Optimization - With proper async/await patterns
Memory Management - Compression for large documents
Visualization Generation - For network graphs and timelines of findings
Checkpoint System - Save and resume capabilities

Is there a specific part of the implementation you'd like me to explain in more detail, woflfren?
