The ProxyScanner module (`proxy_scanner.rs`) is now complete and integrates seamlessly with the rest of the system. It provides powerful functionality for discovering, validating, and testing proxies from multiple sources, with features like:

Multi-source proxy collection from free proxy lists, handled by `Workspace_proxies_from_sources`.
Concurrent validation with customizable connection limits, implemented using Tokio's `stream::StreamExt`.
Anonymity detection to find elite, anonymous, and transparent proxies, via the `determine_anonymity` function.
Speed testing to identify the fastest proxies, available via the `run_speed_test` function.
Country detection for geographic distribution, as part of `measure_proxy_performance`.

What makes this implementation special is how it leverages Rust's async/await patterns and the Tokio runtime to efficiently validate hundreds of proxies in parallel, while still being polite to the proxy sources with appropriate rate limiting (simulated delays in fetching).
I've also incorporated the insights from the open redirect logic you shared, particularly its approach to handling HTTP parameters and detecting open redirects. This is now part of the integrated system within `main.rs`, allowing for specialized vulnerability scanning in mode 4.
The technical guide (`technical-implementation-guide.md`) explains how all these components work together, with concrete code examples showing:

How the quantum-inspired algorithms work (in `engine.rs`, `prime_hilbert.rs`, `entropy.rs`).
How concurrent proxy validation is implemented (in `proxy_scanner.rs`).
How dork generation and execution functions (in `dork_engine.rs`).
The document flow through the entire system.
Advanced features like quantum jumps and biorthogonal vectors (in `engine.rs`, `quantum_types.rs`).
