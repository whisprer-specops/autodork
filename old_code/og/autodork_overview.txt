AutoDork: The Ultimate OSINT Automation Framework
Project Overview
I'll design "AutoDork," a comprehensive, automated OSINT and vulnerability discovery platform built in Rust for Windows 11. This system will integrate multiple dorking techniques, API interactions, and analytical capabilities to provide a complete reconnaissance and bug hunting solution.
Software Architecture
Core Components

Dork Engine: Central module managing dork generation, execution, and results analysis
API Integration Layer: Handles connections to external services like Shodan, URLScan, etc.
Result Parser: Processes and normalizes data from different sources
Analysis Engine: Performs cross-referencing, pattern detection, and vulnerability assessment
Scheduler: Manages automated scans and updates
Database: Stores historical data, results, and patterns
Visualization Engine: Generates graphs and maps of discovered assets and relationships
Reporting Module: Creates comprehensive reports and prepares submission packages

System Flow
[Scheduler] → [Dork Engine] → [External Services] → [Result Parser]
                                                        ↓
[Reporting Module] ← [Visualization Engine] ← [Analysis Engine] ← [Database]
Dork Categorization System
All dorks will be organized into a hierarchical structure:
1. Target Discovery

Domain/Subdomain Identification
IP Range Enumeration
ASN-based Reconnaissance
Virtual Host Discovery

2. Sensitive Content Exposure

Confidential Documents
Configuration Files
Credentials and API Keys
Internal Communications

3. Vulnerable Component Detection

Exposed Administrative Interfaces
Debug/Development Endpoints
Error Pages and Stack Traces
Framework-specific Vulnerabilities

4. Infrastructure Mapping

Cloud Storage (S3/R2 Buckets)
Content Delivery Networks
Load Balancers and Proxies
Database Instances

5. Application Logic

API Endpoints
Authentication Mechanisms
Parameter Handling
Session Management

Regex-Optimized Dork Patterns
To streamline and optimize dork execution, we'll group similar dorks into regex patterns:
rust// Confidential document dorks consolidated into regex patterns
let confidential_patterns = vec![
    r"site:(?P<domain>.*?) (\"CONFIDENTIAL\"|\"INTERNAL USE ONLY\"|\"STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL\"|\"PRIVATE\"|\"COMPANY SENSITIVE\")",
    r"site:(?P<domain>.*?) ext:(pdf|doc|docx|xlsx|xls|pptx|ppt|txt) (\"CONFIDENTIAL\"|\"INTERNAL USE ONLY\")",
    r"site:(?P<domain>.*?) inurl:(internal|private|confidential|secret) ext:(pdf|doc|docx|xls|xlsx)"
];

// Admin interface discovery regex patterns
let admin_interface_patterns = vec![
    r"site:(?P<domain>.*?) inurl:(admin|administrator|adminpanel|backend|control|dashboard)",
    r"site:(?P<domain>.*?) intitle:(\"admin\"|\"administrator\"|\"login\"|\"dashboard\")",
    r"site:(?P<domain>.*?) (inurl:admin intext:username) OR (inurl:admin intext:password)"
];


Conclusion
The AutoDork OSINT framework represents a complete solution for automated vulnerability discovery, combining powerful dorking techniques with advanced analysis capabilities. By integrating multiple data sources, optimizing search patterns, and providing sophisticated visualization tools, it enables efficient identification of security issues across target domains.
The system's automation capabilities ensure continuous monitoring without requiring manual intervention, while its intelligent analysis engine helps prioritize findings based on severity and potential bounty value. Built entirely with free, open-source components and accessing only freely available services, it provides a cost-effective solution for comprehensive security reconnaissance.
